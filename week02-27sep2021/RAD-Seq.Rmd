### Summary RAD-Seq

Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) is a method that provides 
genomic data for any organism with high resolution at fair price by reducing the 
complexity of the target genome across many individuals. \
RAD-Seq allows the identification and the scoring of many genetic markers 
(microsatellites, single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertionâ€“deletion polymorphisms, 
etc) over a group of samples by preprocessing the raw DNA material and then using the
Illumina technology underneath. The preprocessing step is based on the use of 
restriction enzymes to cut the desired fragments from the DNA and on the use of molecular 
identifiers to pinpoint the particular individual and their sequencing reads.
